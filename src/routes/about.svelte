	About Me
</h1>

<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
I'm Hadi, a French developer, working in infosec, enthusiastic about nix, golang &amp; blockchains. ☁️
I deeply value open-source projects &amp; actively seek ways to contribute to the community.
I enjoy the challenge of reimagining existing apps &amp; scripts in my own unique way.
By creating these projects from scratch, I can ensure complete control over every aspect of their design and functionality.
