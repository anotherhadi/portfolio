	About Me
</h1>

<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
	French developer enthusiastic about bash, golang, infosec & blockchains ☁️ I deeply value
	open-source projects & actively seek ways to contribute to the community. I'm particularly
	interested in emerging technologies such as blockchains and cryptocurrency. I enjoy the challenge
	of reimagining existing apps & scripts in my own unique way. By creating these projects from
	scratch, I can ensure complete control over every aspect of their design and functionality.
